"""Seed the first admin account (so login works immediately after deploy)

Revision ID: 016
Revises: 015
Create Date: 2026-05-29

Inserts a single admin only if NO admin exists yet — idempotent and safe
alongside the env-var seed (ensure_seed_admin). Stores only the bcrypt hash
(irreversible). CHANGE THIS PASSWORD from the Profile page after first login.
